# Admin Panel based on Tailwind CSS

Simple admin panel interface using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Still far far away from complete.

Everything still uses basic tailwind utilities, no custom component (like creating a button, label, or alert component using `@apply`).

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

After that, start up Webpack Development Server:

```
npm run dev
```
